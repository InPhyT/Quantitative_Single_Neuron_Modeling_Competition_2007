The two given cells (C010302A1, C140201C) are courtesy of the Blue Brain Project (http://bluebrainproject.epfl.ch). 

They are made publicly available for the purpose of the workshop "Quantitative Neuron Modeling: Predicting every spike?" organized by EPFL and UCL on June 25-26, 2007. In case you publish your model, proper reference has to be given. Please contact Felix Schuermann (felix.schuermann@epfl.ch).


Cell C010302A1 is a pyramidal cell of the continuously adapting (cAD) type.
Cell C140201C is a bitufted cell of initial bursting non-fastspiking, non-adapting (bNA) type

Both cells are from the somatosensory cortex (non barrel) of young rats (p13/p15)
