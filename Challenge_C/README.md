# Challenge C

Two electrode data from cortical neurons under random current injection at soma and dendrite. 
Stimulation is done with currents of different means and fluctuation amplitudes. Some traces (input current plus measured voltage) are given for training. Several stimulation sets are set apart for the prediction.
